        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This grilled asparagus will taste best the day it’s cooked. 
            However, if you have leftovers, you can store them in an 
            airtight container in the refrigerator for up to three days. 
            The asparagus should be perfectly cooked after three to five 
            minutes on a lightly grill heated to high heat. You’ll know 
            the asparagus spears are done when they are lightly charred 
            and tender when pierced with a fork.  
        </p>
